# I'm sorry

Unfortunately, I was unable to meet the deadline on this module. I'm ready to accept all consequences of such actions and will try to provide all tsks completed as soon as possible. 

UPD: Task finished completely.

Time tracking:

01.05: 12:00 - 17:00, 19:00 - 21:00
Total: 14 hours

It's still a lot, but i might have accomplished this in deadline, if not for my job and other distractions.
